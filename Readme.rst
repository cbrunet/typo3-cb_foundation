Foundation framework
====================

Foundation_ describes itself as *the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world*.
It includes many features, such as:

* Normalization of website appearance across different browsers
* A grid to easily define columns of different widths for you content
* Fully responsive, to build websites that look good on all sizes of screens
* A bunch of JavaScript utilities to define image sliders, off-canvas menus, etc.
* And mush more!

This extension allows to easily install and setup Foundation to use it as a basis for your website template.
While you could simply download the Foundation framework directly from its official website,
the use of this TYPO3 extension has several advantages:

* It eases the upgrade to a new version of Foundation, especially if you are maintaining many websites
* It loads all the needed JavaScript and CSS files for you
* You can easily configure some parameters directly from the TYPO3 backend

Actually, the following features are supported:

* Includes all CSS and JS libraries of Foundation
* Includes all SCSS files needed for customizing the CSS
* Default CSS files for quick testing or prototyping
* A few ready-to-use plugins:
  
  * Orbit slider
  * Clearing lightbox
  * Flexible video container
  * Breadcrumbs navigation
  * Magellan sticky navigation

More feature will peoabably be added in future releases.
